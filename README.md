# Medication App

A modern Android application for managing medical problems and associated medications. Built with Jetpack Compose and following clean architecture principles.

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram]

The application follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with Clean Architecture principles:

- **View (UI/XML)**: The UI layer built with Jetpack Compose that handles user interactions
- **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediate layer containing UI logic and state management using RxJava/LiveData
- **Repository**: Central point for data management that coordinates between local and remote data sources
- **Data Sources**:
  - Local DataSource: Handles local database operations using Room
  - Remote DataSource: Manages API calls and network operations

The architecture ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Unidirectional data flow
- Better testability
- Offline-first capability

## Features

## Database Schema

### Problems Table

CREATE TABLE problems (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    problemData TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE drugs (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    dose TEXT NOT NULL,
    strength TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE problem_drug_cross_ref (
    problemId INTEGER NOT NULL,
    drugName TEXT NOT NULL,
    className TEXT NOT NULL,
    classType TEXT NOT NULL,
    associatedDrugType TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (problemId, drugName),
    FOREIGN KEY (problemId) REFERENCES problems(id),
